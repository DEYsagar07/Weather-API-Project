🚀 Weather API Project: Automated Weather Data Pipeline 🌦️

I’m excited to share my latest project—a fully automated weather data pipeline using modern tools and technologies! 🌟

🔍 Project Overview:
This system fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API, processes it, and makes it available for insights and visualization.

🔗 Key Highlights:
1️⃣ Dockerized Python Script: Runs daily at 10 AM, fetching the latest weather data through REST API calls.
2️⃣ Apache Airflow: Seamlessly handles data transformation using DAG workflows.
3️⃣ PostgreSQL Database: Ensures efficient and reliable storage of transformed data.
4️⃣ Power BI Dashboards: Provides actionable insights and beautiful weather visualizations.

This architecture is designed for scalability, efficiency, and accuracy—ideal for projects needing real-time data analysis.
